# Flappy-Dragon

Simple implementation of flappy bird in rust. Based on the Flappy-Dragon exercise in the book 'Hands-on Rust'.

Not intended to be a great example of how to structure a project. Just playing around with the library the book is using.

## Run
- `cargo run`

## Build
- `cargo build --release`
